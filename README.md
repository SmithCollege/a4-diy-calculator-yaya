Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

I definitely didn't struggle on this assignment as much as previous ones but I will say that the Infix class was pretty difficult to implement. Specifically, I had a hard time dealing with parentheses and the logic behind when knowing if there were mismatched parentheses. However, I do feel that his assignment helped reinforce my knowledge of how stacks, queue, and deques work.

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?
No.
